Meal prep doesn’t have to take over Sunday. A focused plan keeps flavor high and waste low.

## Map the menu
Choose two mains, one breakfast, and a hero sauce. This creates variety without overwhelming your schedule.

### Check the inventory
Peek at your freezer and pantry so you use what you already have before shopping.

## Shop with purpose
Group your list by store section. You’ll move faster and avoid impulse buys.

### Prep in stations
Roast sheet pans first, simmer soups next, and finish with no-cook items. Layering tasks keeps momentum going.

## Store for success
Label containers with the meal name and date. Portion snacks into grab-and-go jars so your weekday self says “thanks.”

With a little planning, weekend prep becomes your low-stress launchpad into a fueled week.
