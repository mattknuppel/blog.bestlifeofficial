Keeping nutrition on track starts with building small systems that work even when life gets chaotic.

## Start with a keystone habit
Pick one habit that unlocks many others. Prepping breakfast the night before or filling a water bottle before bed can
set up every morning for success.

### Script the behavior
Write out the exact steps: "After I clean up dinner, I will soak oats, portion fruit, and set a reminder on my phone."
This reduces decision fatigue.

## Track friction and adjust
Every routine faces resistance. Identify where the wheels fall off, then tweak the environment—move snack staples to the
front of the pantry, or schedule grocery delivery after training.

### Use check-ins
A weekly reflection questions what worked, what felt hard, and what will you change. Keep it to five minutes with your
favorite beverage.

## Celebrate small wins
Habit loops reinforce when you celebrate. Pair your routine with a quick note to a friend or log your streak in a tracker.

The goal isn’t perfection. It’s building a repeatable system that moves you toward your best life one meal at a time.
