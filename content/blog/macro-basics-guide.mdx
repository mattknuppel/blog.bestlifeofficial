Macros are the building blocks of every training plan. Understanding how each macronutrient supports performance makes
meal planning easier.

## Protein repairs muscle
Aim for 0.7–1 gram per pound of bodyweight depending on training intensity.

### Distribute across the day
Four balanced servings of 25–35 grams keep muscle protein synthesis humming.

## Carbs fuel work
Complex carbohydrates power long sessions and everyday energy. Think roasted potatoes, quinoa, oats, and fruit.

### Periodize around training
Match carb intake to workout intensity. Eat more on long or high-intensity days, and taper slightly on rest days.

## Fat supports hormones
Omega-3 and monounsaturated fats keep joints and hormones happy. Sprinkle nuts, seeds, avocado, and olive oil into meals.

### Balance your plate
Combine all three macros with veggies for fiber and micronutrients. Our calculators can help you dial in the ratios that
fit your goals.
