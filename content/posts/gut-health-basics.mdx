The foundations of gut health look suspiciously like general healthy living: diverse plants, adequate fibre, and stress hygiene.

## Fibre first, supplements second

Most Australians average only 21 g fibre daily—well below the 25–30 g recommendation. Before shopping for expensive powders,
 audit your daily plants. Aim for 30 different plant foods each week.

## Stress and sleep still matter

Chronic stress shifts gut-brain signalling. Breathing drills, walking breaks, and consistent bedtime cues stabilise the nervous system.

<Note>
If you experience persistent digestive symptoms, seek assessment from a gastroenterologist or accredited practising dietitian.

## What about probiotics?

  cons={["Strain specificity matters", "Often unnecessary when diet quality is high"]}

## Focused action plan

1. Build colourful meals anchored by whole grains, legumes, and vegetables.
2. Layer fermented foods (yoghurt, kefir, kimchi) 3–4 times per week.
3. Track stress triggers and trial one calming ritual daily.
