Nutrition labels are designed to inform—but clever marketing can bury the truth. Learn how to scan packaging quickly and spot red flags.

<Callout type="warning" title="Watch Serving Sizes">
Always compare the label serving size to how much you actually plan to eat. Many snacks list unrealistically small amounts.

## Prioritize the ingredient list

1. **Shorter is often better.** The fewer ultra-processed additives, the easier it is to understand what you are eating.
2. **Look for hidden sugars.** Words ending in “-ose” or syrups in the top three ingredients signal added sugars.
3. **Check the oils.** Choose products with olive, avocado, or canola oil over hydrogenated fats.

<Note>
Marketing claims like “multigrain” or “made with fruit” can still mask high sugar or refined flour. Let the ingredient list be your guide.

## Evaluate the numbers

<NutritionTable items={[
  { food: "Whole-grain crackers", serving: "30 g", protein: "3 g", carbs: "20 g", fat: "6 g" },
  { food: "Yogurt cup", serving: "170 g", protein: "12 g", carbs: "18 g", fat: "4 g" },
]} />

<ProsCons pros={["Helps you avoid hidden sugars", "Supports balanced macronutrients"]} cons={["Takes extra time at first", "Some brands change formulas often"]} />

Keep a running list on your phone of staples that meet your standards. Once you find trusted brands, restocking becomes effortless.
