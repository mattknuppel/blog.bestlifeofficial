## Why strength still matters when time is tight

Research shows adults can maintain muscle and bone density with two full-body resistance sessions per week. That means a busy calendar doesn&apos;t have to compromise healthspan.

## The 4-hour framework

1. **Two strength days** — 45 minutes each with compound lifts (squat, hinge, push, pull).
2. **Two micro sessions** — 20-minute mobility or core circuits on high-stress days.
3. **Active commute** — short walks between meetings to keep daily movement high.

## Keep the momentum going

Strength training twice weekly is a baseline for healthy adults.

Set a quarterly reminder to reassess loads and mobility limitations. Progress is rarely linear, but presence builds resilience.
