## Step 1: Identify the gap

Are you correcting a deficiency, supporting a medical condition, or chasing performance? Define the job-to-be-done before adding anything new.

## Step 2: Review the evidence

Search trusted databases like Examine.com and look for systematic reviews. Check dosage, population studied, and outcome measures.

## Step 3: Safety screening

Discuss supplements with your healthcare provider—especially if pregnant, breastfeeding, or taking prescription medication.

## Step 4: Track and reassess

Log start date, dosage, and subjective outcomes. Set a calendar reminder to evaluate after 8–12 weeks.
