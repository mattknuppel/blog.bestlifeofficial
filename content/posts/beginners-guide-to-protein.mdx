Protein is essential for preserving lean mass, supporting immune health, and keeping you satisfied between meals. Yet most people underestimate how much they need—especially during stressful seasons or while training.

<Callout type="info" title="Daily Range">
Aim for 1.2–1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight unless your clinician advises otherwise.
</Callout>

## Spread it across the day

Your muscles can only use so much protein at once. Distribute intake evenly:

- 20–35 grams at breakfast
- 25–40 grams at lunch
- 25–40 grams at dinner
- Optional 15–20 gram snack (Greek yogurt, edamame, protein smoothie)

<Note>
Plant-forward? Mix legumes with whole grains (think lentils + quinoa) to create a complete amino acid profile.

## What about shakes?

"Protein supplements should fill gaps—not replace meals. Anchor each shake with fruits or veggies to boost micronutrients."

Stay hydrated, pair protein with carbohydrates post-workout for recovery, and keep an eye on total caloric needs. More is not always better—focus on consistency.
