        How you spend the first hour of your morning has the power to shape the pace, energy, and
        clarity you experience all day long. Create a ritual that feels supportive—not stressful—by
        weaving together habits that nourish both your body and your mindset.
      </p>

      <h2>Start with intentional wake-up cues</h2>
      <p>
        Swap blaring alarms for gentle sounds or a sunrise lamp that eases you into wakefulness.
        As you sit up in bed, take three slow breaths and notice one thing you feel grateful for.
        This quick scan shifts your attention toward possibility instead of urgency.
      </p>

      <h2>Hydrate before caffeine</h2>
      <p>
        After hours of sleep, your body craves hydration. Keep a glass of water on your nightstand
        or infuse a pitcher with citrus and herbs the evening before. Drinking water first thing
        supports digestion, boosts focus, and reminds you to prioritize yourself before the day
        begins.
      </p>

      <h2>Create a mini movement routine</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Two minutes of gentle stretching to wake up your joints</li>
        <li>Five cat-cow flows to mobilize your spine</li>
        <li>Thirty seconds of shoulder rolls paired with deep breaths</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Movement increases circulation and shakes away morning grogginess. Pick an activity that
        feels inviting—yoga, a quick walk, or simple body-weight exercises all count.
      </p>

      <h2>Fuel with a balanced breakfast</h2>
      <p>
        Aim for a mix of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. A smoothie bowl, avocado toast with
        poached eggs, or chia pudding topped with berries are all easy options you can prep ahead of
        time. Pair your meal with uplifting music or a mindful podcast to inspire your next steps.
      </p>

      <h2>Set the day's intention</h2>
      <p>
        Close your ritual by writing down one focus for the day and a supportive affirmation. When
        midday distractions arise you can return to these reminders to realign with what matters.
        Consistency, not perfection, is the key—adapt these ideas until they feel like second nature.
